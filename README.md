CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR ANALYTICS

ABSTRACT:

Consumer behaviour analytics is crucial for businesses to understand and cater to the evolving needs and preferences of their target audience. With the proliferation of data and advancements in machine learning techniques, leveraging predictive analytics has become increasingly important in deciphering consumer behaviour patterns.This paper explores the application of machine learning algorithms in consumer behaviour analytics, focusing on their ability to predict consumer preferences, forecast purchasing trends, and personalize marketing strategies.By analyzing large-scale datasets encompassing demographic information, past purchasing behavior, and online interactions, machine learning models can uncover hidden patterns and correlations that traditional analytical methods might overlook.Through case studies and empirical evidence, this paper highlights the effectiveness of machine learning in enhancing marketing effectiveness, optimizing pricing strategies, and improving customer segmentation. Additionally, it discusses challenges such as data privacy concerns and model interpretability and proposes future research directions to further advance the field of consumer behaviour analytics using machine learning. Overall, this paper underscores the transformative potential of machine learning in driving actionable insights and facilitating data-driven decision-making for businesses in today's competitive marketplace.
By analyzing consumer behaviour, businesses can better understand their target audience, predict future trends, and tailor their marketing strategies to effectively engage customers. This data-driven approach enables companies to make informed decisions about product development, pricing, promotion, and distribution channels.
